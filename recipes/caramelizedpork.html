        <h2>Vietnamese Caramelized Ground Pork Bowl</h2>
            <p>Are you tired of going to the grocery store only to leave with the same boring meals you've had repeatedly over the last few weeks? I've been there! I started browsing the meat department and saw ground pork... what could I do with that? So I looked it up and found this delicious sweet and savory caramelized pork recipe.</p>
            <p>I have done multiple takes on this recipe personally and suggest you do the same! The standard recipe source recommends you use fish sauce but I substitute soy sauce. I also keep adding the "sauce" base ingredients until I get an amount I like. To make a version of the pork bowl like an egg roll bowl, throw in your rice and a package of coleslaw mix!</p>
