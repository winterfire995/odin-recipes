        <h2>Sausage and Peppers Over Egg Noodles</h2>
            <p>This is a classic sausage and peppers dish with an adjustable spice level served over egg noodles. It's a hearty, savory take on the classic sandwich, but feel free to leave out the noodles and throw it on a bun instead!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>olive oil</li>
                <li>1 lb Italian sausage (mild, medium, hot, sweet)</li>
                <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
                <li>1 green bell pepper</li>
                <li>1 pepper of another color</li>
                <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
                <li>salt (to taste)</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic (chopped)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup red wine (optional)</li>
                <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
                <li>Italian seasoning (to taste)</li>
                <li>red pepper flakes (to taste)</li>
                <li>1/2 lb egg noodles</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p>While you work on the following steps, you may wish to boil water for your noodles. Cook them while you make the rest of the dish for more efficiency!</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a couple tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat in a pan that has a lid. Add the sausages and brown them slowly, turning occasionally. Once browned, remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
                <li>In the same pan, add the onions and peppers. Stir to coat in the oil, sautee. Season as desired. When peppers and onions have a good sear, add the garlic and cook an additional minute.</li>
                <li>Deglaze the pan with red wine. Gently scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen any burnt on/brown bits. Cook the wine down by half.</li>
                <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, seasoning, and red pepper flakes (if desired), and stir. Return the sausages to the pan, bring to a simmer. Then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until the sausages are cooked through. This may take about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once cooked, serve over a bed of egg noodles. Enjoy!</li>
