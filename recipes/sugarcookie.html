        <h2>Sugar Cookie Holiday Shapes in the Air Fryer</h2>
        <p>Have you ever wanted just a couple freshly baked cookies but you don't want to heat your house by turning on the oven? If you're impatient like me, it won't even be about the heat alone. Who wants to wait for it to get to the right temperature?</p>
        <p>Well now you don't have to! If you have an air fryer hanging out in your kitchen and you're looking for just another fun way to use it, look no further! Now you can make just a couple cookies, fresh baked, on demand, in just about 10 minutes!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pillsbury Ready to Bake shaped cookie dough (you may substitute other kinds of cookie dough, but know that temperature and timing may very)</li>
                <li>air fryer</li>
                <li>foil or silicone liner</li>
                <li>sweet tooth</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place aluminum foil or silicone liner into air fryer basket.</li>
                <li>Place the selected number of cookies onto the foil/liner about 2 inches apart. I can comfortably fit at least 4 in the Instant Pot air fryer basket.</li>
                <li>Set your air fryer to 350 degrees and your timer for 8-10 minutes. I prefer my cookies a little bit dough-y but use caution if eating raw cookie dough! It is recommended to bake fully.</li>
                <li>If they do not appear fully cooked, start your air fryer again for another 1-2 minutes at a time until lightly golden brown on the edges.</li>
                <Li>Cool and enjoy!</Li>
            </ol>
